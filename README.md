# Map_creation
Project shows you the closest and the furthest points to your 
locations, where were shot films of the same century as a year,
you inputed.

# Description_of_project
In main.py module we run a function: put_points_on_map(lat, lon, year). 

You should set in arguments your latitude and longitude coordinates (lat, lon) and a year of film shooting.
 
You will see on map three the closed location of films, which was shot in the century that represents the 
year you inputted. You will also see three the furthest locations from you of films shot in the same century 
as a year you inputted.

Closest location will be represented on map as a #blue drops.

Furthest location will be represented on map as a #red circles.

Your location will be represented on map as a #green circle.

# Visuals
##main.py  module:

After running this module, the map you see below will be generated.

Each time you generate a map, blue drops and red circled will have different location.

This is because a new list of films is generating after a new run of program.
Therefore the distance between locations will be different.
